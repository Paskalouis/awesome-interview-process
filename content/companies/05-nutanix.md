## Rounds Description

1. **Exploratory Discussion:** This round is mostly about the candidate knowing the company and vice-versa. They don't only expect the candidate to tell everything about himself/herself but also they are equally curious to tell about the company as well.
2. **Live Coding:** This round depends on the type of role a person is applying for, I applied for Frontend Developer role. This round usually expects a candiate to be calm and open up for the discussion, the round not only expects how a candidate approaches a problem but also how he/she shares their thought process about choosing a technology, the good practices and most importantly the right attitude.
3. **Architecture Round:** This round involves how a person would design their whole application in general. Expectations from a candidate may vary depending on the years of experience. They don't expect a full-fledged solution but again the approach is something which matters.

4. **Lunch:** As a part of their culture, after architecture round, they take the candidate for lunch to know better (which I personally liked it because that clearly justified their welcoming attitude)

5. **Managerial Round:** This round is typically focussed on the cultural fitment of the candidate. Manager tells about the team a candidate will be working in, what are the responsibilities he/she has to take. All other questions that candidate might have are totally welcome. 

## Appendix

- **Scripted Questions** - Describes if the company asks questions which are kind of direct bookish questions or can be easily found on internet infact on the first result page on google üòõ. Example: Write a function to print first 100 fibonnaci numbers, How does event loop works, write a polyfil for X etc.
- **DS and Algo** - Describes if the company asks DS and algo questions which which are kind of direct bookish questions about data structure and algorithms instead of a real life problem.
